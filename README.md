# Comparative-Analysis-of-OpenCV-Recognisers-for-Face-Recognition
I have written a research paper on the topic of "Comparative Analysis of OpenCV Recognisers for Face Recognition". The Paper is published in the "IEEE Conference Publication".

Face recognition has been one of the fast-growing, exacting and very keen areas in real-time applications. It is seemingly an individual's most extraordinary physical trademark. While people have had the intrinsic capacity to perceive and recognize various faces for many years, computers are a little difficult to perform so while it's getting up to speed. Facial recognition programming is intended to pinpoint a face and measure its highlights or various components. In this paper we compared three different algorithms for face detection.
